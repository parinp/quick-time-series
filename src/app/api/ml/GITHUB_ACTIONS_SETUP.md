# Setting Up GitHub Actions for Continuous Deployment

This guide will help you set up GitHub Actions to automatically deploy your FastAPI application to Google Cloud Run whenever you push changes to your repository.

## Prerequisites

1. A GitHub repository containing your code
2. A Google Cloud Platform account with billing enabled
3. A Google Cloud project with Cloud Run API enabled

## Step 1: Create a Service Account for GitHub Actions

1. Go to the [IAM & Admin > Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) page in the Google Cloud Console
2. Click "Create Service Account"
3. Enter a name (e.g., "github-actions-deployer") and description
4. Click "Create and Continue"
5. Add the following roles:
   - Cloud Run Admin
   - Storage Admin
   - Service Account User
   - Cloud Build Editor
6. Click "Done"

## Step 2: Create and Download a Service Account Key

1. In the Service Accounts list, find the account you just created
2. Click the three dots menu (â‹®) and select "Manage keys"
3. Click "Add Key" > "Create new key"
4. Select JSON format and click "Create"
5. Save the downloaded JSON file securely (you'll need it in the next step)

## Step 3: Add Secrets to Your GitHub Repository

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions"
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Add the following secrets:
   - Name: `GCP_PROJECT_ID`
     Value: Your Google Cloud project ID
   - Name: `GCP_SA_KEY`
     Value: The entire contents of the JSON key file you downloaded

## Step 4: Set Up the GitHub Actions Workflow

The workflow file has already been created at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. Make sure this directory exists in your repository.

If you need to create the directory structure:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cp src/app/api/ml/.github/workflows/deploy.yml .github/workflows/
```

## Step 5: Push Your Code to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow for continuous deployment"
git push
```

## How It Works

1. When you push changes to the `main` branch that affect files in the specified paths, the workflow will trigger
2. GitHub Actions will:
   - Build a Docker image using your Dockerfile
   - Push the image to Google Container Registry
   - Deploy the image to Cloud Run

## Monitoring Deployments

You can monitor your deployments in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository.

## Troubleshooting

If your deployment fails, check the following:

1. Verify that your secrets are correctly set up in GitHub
2. Ensure your service account has the necessary permissions
3. Check the GitHub Actions logs for specific error messages
4. Verify that your Dockerfile is correctly configured

## Free Tier Considerations

GitHub Actions offers a free tier with:
- 2,000 minutes per month for public repositories
- 500 minutes per month for private repositories

This is typically sufficient for small to medium-sized projects with moderate update frequency.
