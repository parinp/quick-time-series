# ML Analysis API

This is a FastAPI-based API for performing machine learning analysis on time series data using XGBoost regression and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability.

## Features

- XGBoost regression model training on time series data
- Feature extraction from date fields
- Model performance metrics (RMSE, RÂ²)
- Feature importance analysis
- SHAP analysis with visualizations:
  - Summary plot
  - Bar plot
  - Beeswarm plot
  - Waterfall plot

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- XGBoost
- SHAP
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Installation

Make sure you have all the required packages installed:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn xgboost shap pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Running the API Server

### Windows

```bash
# Navigate to the API directory
cd src/app/api/ml

# Run the server
run_server.bat
```

Or directly:

```bash
python server.py
```

### Unix/Linux/Mac

```bash
# Navigate to the API directory
cd src/app/api/ml

# Make the script executable
chmod +x run_server.sh

# Run the server
./run_server.sh
```

Or directly:

```bash
python server.py
```

The server will start on http://localhost:8000 by default.

## API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can access the auto-generated API documentation at:

- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
